#fluentspacefood-o-rama!
***
### The story :
Three coworkers at [Fluent Space](http://fluentspace.my) went to lunch, and as usual, spent an hour trying to decide where to go. So we came up with the idea of a fluentspacefood-o-rama - give us ONE place to eat lunch at today!

### Gimme the tech lowdown!

- Python 2.7.2
- Django 1.5.1
- PostgreSQL
- [Foursquare Venue Explore API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/explore)

### I wanna help!
These are among some of the things that would be nice to have:

- Venue tips!
- List down specials (if any)
- Venue photos
- Really, anything that can make this better!

### I wanna help, but I'm not a python hacker :(
There's always **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** portions that can be improved :)

Heck, python/django's not that hard to learn. Use this as a way to learn python/django!
